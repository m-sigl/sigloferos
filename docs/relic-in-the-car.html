  <h1>In the Car, Not Mike</h1>
  <div class="tagline">Relic 0004 — the imagined betrayal</div>

  <article>
    <small>“The body doesn't lie. But sometimes, it says too much.”</small>

    <p>She left for the weekend. Said she was visiting her mom.  
    Said she was just catching up with family. A quiet trip. A needed reset.</p>

    <p>But something soured in the silence.  
    He felt it the moment she returned—  
    a strange detachment, a sweetness too artificial, like the mask you wear after breaking something you can’t replace.</p>

    <p>Their phone plan was shared. He saw the texts.  
    Hundreds, over two weeks. A number not mentioned. A name conveniently omitted.  
    Some deleted. Recovered.  
    It wasn’t a guess anymore—it was a ghost he could trace.</p>

    <p>She confessed only what he could prove.  
    <em>Yes, we kissed.</em>  
    <em>Yes, he got excited.</em>  
    But only that. Only ever that.</p>

    <p>But the mind doesn't end where proof does.</p>

    <p>He sees her now—still, in his mind—leaning against the car, lips pressed to a stranger.  
    Not Mike. That’s why it thrilled her.  
    Not the man who tried. Not the man who waited, and spoke, and planned.  
    This was escape. Dirt. Not love.</p>

    <p>She drags him into the passenger seat, breath hot and eager.  
    His pants down. Her mouth on him.  
    She moans—not for him, but for the relief of forgetting Mike.</p>

    <p>And when he finishes, she doesn’t flinch.  
    She lets it mark her.  
    A mess she chose. A moment that felt real—because it wasn’t safe.</p>

    <p><strong>He never saw it.  
    But it plays, again and again, like the world’s worst private screening.  
    Not because he wanted to watch—  
    but because he couldn’t forget the shape of her silence.</strong></p>
