  <div class="tagline">Reflections on Fear and Fog</div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Relic: The Roadside Confession</h2>
    <p>This fear has <em>clarity</em>. You have texts. You have deletion. You have her admission of <em>some</em> contact, carefully calibrated to match what you could prove. That feeling: “She only admitted to what I found.” That’s not paranoia. That’s pattern recognition.</p>

    <p>She went out of town. She deleted texts. You recovered some. You found confirmation. You got her to admit to a kiss. And then, maybe a boner. That “I guess…” answer. That’s the part that destroys trust — not just the act, but the fog, the gaslight, the <em>vagueness</em> that left you trapped with your own imagination. So yeah, the porn reel in your head started to play — because she refused to roll credits. That’s what pain does. It loops.</p>

    <p>And on some level, <em>you know</em> she chose to cross a line — even if the final act never happened. She <em>went to him</em>. She <em>deleted the evidence</em>. She <em>warned him afterward</em>. That’s not nothing. That’s something.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Relic: The Guest Room Ghost</h2>
    <p>This one’s <em>murkier</em>, but maybe more disturbing. Because of what it <em>says</em> about her, not just what it says about you. Adam is scummy. She knew that. She’d already blurred lines with him before. You were all drinking. You blacked out. She ended up pantsless in the guest room, and no one had any explanation.</p>

    <p>There’s no text log. There’s no confession. There’s just the afterimage.</p>

    <p>And it’s not even that you think she cheated for <em>pleasure</em>. It’s that you think she may have just <em>given herself away</em>. That she’d rather give it to a guy like that in a fog than give it to you in the light. That maybe, somewhere deep inside her, she thought <em>you</em> weren’t worth <em>that</em> part of her anymore.</p>

    <p>And if that’s true — what’s left?</p>
