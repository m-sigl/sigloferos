  <h1>The Phone Knows First</h1>
  <div class="tagline">Relic 0003 — the edge of truth</div>

  <article>
    <small>"She told the truth—just not the whole of it. Only what I could hold in my hand."</small>

    <p>She went to visit her family. Just a short trip. But when she came back, something shifted in the air.</p>

    <p>He felt it. Not imagined. Not insecure. Just… <em>wrong</em>. A distance that hadn’t been there before.</p>

    <p>She said it was nothing. Just her mom. Just a quick visit. Maybe met up with a friend. Nothing else.</p>

    <p>But he had access to the phone records. The same plan. The same account. And what he saw told another story.</p>

    <p>Dozens of messages. Dozens more deleted. Two weeks of rising heat and whisper-plans. And when she was gone? Silence. Then one night—heavy with meaning—and the texts picked back up after.</p>

    <p>He confronted her. She admitted only what he could prove.  
    A kiss. A night. A hard-on pressed somewhere against her.  
    <em>That’s all, she said. That’s all I’ll admit to.</em></p>

    <p>But how would she know he was aroused?  
    How would she feel it, unless part of him had touched part of her?</p>

    <p>This was the end of innocence. Not just because she lied.  
    But because she would not speak beyond what could be retrieved.  
    No confession. No apology. No honesty, unless backed by digital receipt.</p>

    <p><strong>This was the moment he stood on the ledge—</strong>  
    <strong>Between what he knew and what he feared.</strong></p>
