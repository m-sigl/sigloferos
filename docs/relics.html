      <h2>The Dance of the Distracted Bride</h2>
      <p><small>Relic 0001</small></p>

      <p>This is the story of the distracted bride.</p>

      <p>They had dated for ten years. He had wanted to marry her for nearly all of them.</p>

      <p>The venue was perfect. The vegetarian entrée, curated. The quirky photographer captured all the smiles.  
      The nature. The non-religious ceremony. The co-authored vows that felt like promises, but turned out to be performances.</p>

      <p>He stood at the altar and believed.  
      She stood beside him and said yes.</p>

      <p>Something was off.  
      In the weeks before the ceremony, she’d begun to speak about a co-worker. A gym friend.  
      The way her voice tilted upward when she said his name.  
      The way her eyes wandered when asked about him.</p>

      <p>The groom asked, softly.  
      She denied, firmly.</p>

      <p>He wanted a dance. Not just a photo op. A co-authored intimacy. A ritual.  
      She chose a song like checking a box.  
      He danced without prep, without spark. She danced… elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Every misstep whispered: <em>her mind is not here.</em>  
      Every movement echoed: <em>her body is present, her desire is not.</em></p>

      <p>Two years later, in the unraveling silence of divorce, it came out.  
      The co-worker. The crush.  
      The emotional glances. The over-long goodbyes.  
      The bride, tipsy at the other wedding—the <em>real</em> one, the one she felt.</p>

      <p>He brought it up again, even then.  
      She denied. Again.  
      Until she didn’t.</p>

      <p><strong>This was the first fracture. The origin of Sigloferos.  
      Not in rage—but in remembering.</strong></p>
