  <h1>The Altar Without Flame</h1>
  <div class="tagline">Relic 0002 — the death of invitation</div>

  <article>
    <small>“Some touches are colder than silence.”</small>

    <p>This is the story of the death of passion.  
    Not in rage. Not in betrayal.  
    But in the long, slow ache of being <em>unwanted</em>.</p>

    <p>He tried.  
    Not just tenderly. Not just once.  
    He brought massages, games, new ideas, deep talks, roleplay, shared fantasy—  
    invitation after invitation,  
    each one tailored to <em>them</em>.</p>

    <p>He created weekends of magic.  
    A new restaurant. A concert that moved them both.  
    They’d laugh, connect, feel <em>close</em>.  
    And still—when the moment came—  
    she would flinch. Or pull away. Or just… fade.</p>

    <p>No words ever named it.  
    No cruel phrase like <em>“let’s just get this over with.”</em>  
    But her body said it. Her eyes said it.  
    Every time she wouldn’t meet his gaze.</p>

    <p>And so, what was meant to be co-created—  
    a sanctuary of heat and soul and eye contact—  
    became something to endure.  
    A cold script, dimly lit.  
    The silence got louder with every attempt.</p>

    <p>He didn’t leave at once.  
    Because hope doesn’t leave at once.  
    But over time, he began to forget  
    what it felt like to be <em>wanted</em>.  
    To be <em>invited</em>.</p>

    <p>This is not anger. This is not blame.  
    This is the record of a fracture so quiet,  
    it nearly erased him.</p>

    <p><strong>But he writes it now,  
    to remember:  
    He once burned. And he will again.</strong></p>
