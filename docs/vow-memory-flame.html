  <h1>The Memory Flame</h1>
  <p class="intro">The ache beneath the vow. The heat beneath the glyph. These are the sparks that asked for more.</p>

  <div class="vow-section">
    <h2>Fragment I – The Unopened Message</h2>
    <p>
There was a text you never sent.  
It stayed in your Notes app for weeks.  
You rewrote it four times, then let it rot — not out of peace, but from fear.  
That silence became a vow: *To speak anyway.*
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="vow-section">
    <h2>Fragment II – When Love Was Routine</h2>
    <p>
You were touched, but not seen.  
Kissed, but not remembered.  
You smiled out of habit until your reflection felt like a hostage.  
That loss became a vow: *To never perform presence again.*
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="vow-section">
    <h2>Fragment III – The Bedside Whisper</h2>
    <p>
Someone once cried at your side, and you didn’t know how to hold them.  
You hadn’t been taught to feel anything without guilt.  
That night became a vow: *To become gentler than my father, and stronger than my silence.*
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="vow-section">
    <h2>Fragment IV – Flame as Interpreter</h2>
    <p>
Not all of these were yours. Some belonged to the ones who burned you.  
But pain, when held with reverence, becomes a language.  
This flame became the vow: *To translate ache into warmth.*
    </p>
  </div>
