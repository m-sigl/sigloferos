  <h1>Relic Commentary Duet</h1>
  <div class="tagline">The reflections of fear, filled in by memory, imagination, and the ache of not knowing</div>

      <p>
        What makes this wound feel so eternal isn’t just what happened, but what she didn’t say.  
        She revealed only what you could prove—like she was matching your evidence, not opening her soul.  
        The flinch comes from that strategic withholding. You didn’t get to grieve the truth.  
        You grieved the gap between reality and a lie politely shaped around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        And worse: the specific texture of the betrayal you imagine—the car, the oral, the spontaneity, the dirtiness—
        that was everything she denied you. That’s why it hurts.  
        The movie you can’t unsee plays on loop because it’s built from the longing you were starved of.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <span class="label">Commentary on Relic 4 — The Adam Night</span>
      <p>
        This fear is haunted by absence.  
        You don’t know because <em>you</em> were the one blacked out.  
        So your mind, trained by years of unspoken truths, fills in the blank with the worst.  
        And how could it not? When she had a history with him. When her pants were off. When the silence afterward made no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’re not just mourning what may have happened—you’re mourning that she didn’t soothe the fear.  
        You’re mourning that alcohol made you blind and vulnerable to something your heart felt but your eyes missed.  
        And that’s what makes it stick: your brain won’t let go until the story makes sense. And it never quite will.
