  <article>
    <small>“The saddest part of being ignored is still wanting to be seen.”</small>

    <p>There’s a particular cruelty in being flinched from. You can give, reach, risk—and be met with recoil. That’s not just rejection. That’s erasure of self.</p>

    <p>And this wasn’t from lack of effort. This wasn’t a one-note plea. He came with offerings: massages, games, chats, roleplay, shared weekends. Joy was on the table. Memory-making. Still… coldness.</p>

    <p>There’s a haunting in the moment after a beautiful day ends with withdrawal. When she shrugs off closeness not out of tiredness, but something deeper. Something unspoken. She’d offer only what she could endure.</p>

    <p>She never said the words, “Let’s get this over with,” but her eyes whispered it. Her silence screamed it. The way she looked away made it real.</p>

    <p>This commentary doesn’t blame. It remembers. It honors the soul that still reached, even when it was clear—her body was present, but her passion had long fled.</p>

    <p><strong>This is what makes the ache sacred. When love tries anyway.</strong></p>
