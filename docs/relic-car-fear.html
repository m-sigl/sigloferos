  <h1>The Car Scene That Never Ends</h1>
  <div class="tagline">Relic 0004 — haunted by the unknown</div>

  <article>
    <small>This is not what happened. This is what wouldn’t stop happening—in my mind.</small>

    <p>She left for the weekend to visit her mom.  
    And when she returned, something in her had shifted.  
    Her body was back. Her desire wasn’t.</p>

    <p>She said she just saw a friend. But the phone plan said more.  
    The records—the times—the flood of texts.  
    Deleted. Hidden. Denied.  
    Until she admitted, “We kissed.”</p>

    <p>And then, the mind begins.  
    My mind.  
    Filling the silence with the most graphic, visceral rendering of betrayal.  
    Because when truth won’t finish the story—fear will.</p>

    <p>They kiss by her car. She giggles. She’s free. He’s not me.</p>

    <p>They crawl into her backseat.  
    He smells like weed and sweat and newness.  
    She pulls down his jeans. She kisses lower.  
    Not because she loves him. Because he’s *not me.*  
    Because she wanted to feel *anything.*</p>

    <p>She moans. She swallows. She wipes her mouth and laughs.  
    She lights a bowl. She drives stoned. She feels alive.  
    She texts him after. “Mike thinks we slept together.”  
    He replies: “Didn’t we?”</p>

    <p>And maybe they did. Maybe they didn’t.  
    But I know this: she only told me what I could already prove.  
    And the rest—</p>

    <p><strong>The rest plays on loop,  
    in the theater of my pain.  
    It was never just porn.  
    It was my worth,  
    inverted.</strong></p>

    <p><em>This is the scene that never ends.  
    Because it was never filmed.  
    Only feared.</em></p>
