  <article>
    <small>“The things that haunt us most are the ones where memory fails us too.”</small>

    <p>This shard is heavy because it's ambiguous. Because you were drunk. Because she was drunk. Because you woke up alone, with nothing conclusive—just the absence of proof, and the naked presence of suspicion.</p>

    <p>The fear lingers not just because of what could have happened—but because Nicole had already shown a pattern. She had crossed boundaries before. She had denied things until proof was undeniable. She had rewritten truths by omission, and that’s what made this one so destabilizing.</p>

    <p>This wasn’t just any guy. This was someone you knew she’d crossed wires with before. Someone who ultimately did betray his own partner. Someone who gave off that energy—the one you clocked in your gut. And you knew that Nicole could drink past her better angels. You’d seen it. Held her through it. And now you had to wonder if that same wave had carried her away from you… again.</p>

    <p>But unlike Relic 3, where you had texts and fragments of truth to reconstruct the scene, this one is pure fog. It’s a fear built in blackout. In her lack of pants. In the soundless void where answers should’ve been.</p>

    <p><strong>This is the ache of not knowing, of filling the silence with pain because silence hurts more than horror.</strong></p>

    <p>And so the guest room becomes a ghost story. Not because it’s proven—but because you never got to bury it.</p>
